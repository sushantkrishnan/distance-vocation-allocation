Purely algorithmic domain

Make better block diagram
Better ppt with explanation
combination.xlsx add pincode in front of subject. So we can search in combination

Steps : Add pincode, merge preferences
Take college dataset, merge subjects with

title (old...revised title - why changed it)

Implementing Distance Optimisation for Centrally Planned Vocation Allocation Schemes

team members - contribution of every member towards prob statement

Problem
 (refer to notes i sent)

objectives

- Create synthetic datasets that simulate real world conditions for students and colleges and
 are modelled after existing research and studies.
 
- To Develop a vocation allocation scheme that takes into account vocation preferences anddistance metrics to
 create an allocation scheme
- Develop a "goodness" metric to determine the “goodness” of a particular allocation scheme which considers
both student preference and location

uniqueness in the project, objectives - to reduce the gap what you are doin (each and every team member)

how unique contribution by each and every team member

1.Synthetic Dataset Generation

First we referred to a base dataset - put link and image of logo on 1 SLIDE


2.Priority Allocation based on Distance Metric Normalization

3. Vocation Allocation Algorithm

4. "Goodness" metric for Calculation of Results

how much of project have u completed - 80-100%
(done)
- Synthetic Student dataset
- Synthetic college dataset
- PR NO assignment script
- Vocation Allocation algorithm
(in progress)
- Integration of distance optimization into Vocation Allocation algorithm
- "Goodness" Metric Calculation and Results
Completion % - 75%


Results will be based on 
1. plotting %ile of students getting 1st,2nd,3rd preference for 10 unique datasets and interations
2. plotting %ile of students with same pincode as institute

Limitations
Due to time constraints we could not improve the allocation algorithm and adopted a greedy approach to allocation which is not
very time efficient

Distance metrics can be made much more granular, instead of pincode it could be an exact lattitude and longitude location

Future work can be intergrating ML Techniques for distance metric optimization

Future work can be developing a fully functional web interface i.e accounting for all other logistical factors for vocation allocation
